# Community-Min-Language-Rime
This Rime is made with Rime Engine and the original schema is made by a github user named a-thok. You can refer to his repo here https://github.com/a-thok/rime-hokkien. However there is never any update later on and I wish to modified to mix with malaysian words and indonesian words as well, thus I just copied and paste the schema and dict files and modified it. I will give anyone access to the repo and made changes to it if they decide to join the discord server and show interest in updating the dictionary. As long as they don't delete previous entry, everything will be good.

# Important

This romanization is just mainly for easier typing, I am not trying to creating a new Romanization standard. These are just mainly for typing fast and is just a little modification from [Tailo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/臺灣閩南語羅馬字拼音方案) due to other hokkien speaking region has more different vowels.

The /ɯ/ sounds are represented with Y like 汝好 /ɤ/ are represented with v /ə/ are represented with eo. 

Reason for these instead of ir,or,er in Tailo because Hokkien doesn't have any R sounds and I tried to minimize character usage. 

/D/ sounds appears in older time E mun 廈門/ Amoy, Philippine Hokkien as well as Hainanese (They are not part of Southern Min Hokkien, but still important sounds to distinguish). 

I also have made adjustment to the keyboard so even if you type C the ts- sounds will still appear. I have seen multiple romanization from mainland but it seems to have multiple version and very confusing since they are not align with IPA. Until I came accross mainlanders that want to have their own schema, then I will made a few.

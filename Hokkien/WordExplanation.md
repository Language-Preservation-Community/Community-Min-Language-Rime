This section is explanation for the words that seems to have mysterious origin and MOE of Taiwan didn't have much explanation and just assign another word through sounds or similar meaning because is "collequital reading". 代誌 is an example of a word that MOE decide to just assign the word through sounds 早 also have tsai reading however the exact reading for the word is Tsa no tsai.MOE recognises that and just assign the word 早 for it. This section is to explain where I include alternative word origin that I find.
